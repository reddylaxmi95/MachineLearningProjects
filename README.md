# Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms in the COnversion Fraud dataset to determine.
its a Binary class classification problem.

Algorithms implemented are RandomFprest, DecisionTree and SVM
The Best accuracy of 0.97 is obtained by applying the SMOTE Sampling on the dataset and passing the processed data to RandomForest Classifier.

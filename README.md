# Conversion Fraud in Digital Advertising.
The project is  to detect the fraud conversions that happen in the digital advertising. As per the Dataset ML model is built to determine if the conversion is fraud or a valid one. 
	Data pre-processing: Data Cleaning and the EDA Process is done using python libraries numpy, pandas , matplotlib etc. The categorical data is one-hot encoded using pandas get_dummies.
	Missing data in the dataset is treated and the data which are irrelevant to solve the problem are removed.
	SMOTE is used for sampling the data.
	Developed a Random forest classifier model with a accuracy score of 0.97 to classify the dependent variable based on various independent features.
	The other Models which were implemented was Decision tree and SVM which gave a fair accuracy around 0.89 to 0.92.
